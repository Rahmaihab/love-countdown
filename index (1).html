      "Your smile is the melody that plays softly in the background of my days.",
      "Youâ€™re not just a wish come true â€” youâ€™re the whole sky answering me.",

      "Every day with you is my favorite. But one day soon will be even more.",

      "You're the poem I never dared to write, now living in my silence.",
      "If I had one gift to give you, it would be seeing yourself through my eyes.",
      "You're more than a date on the calendar. You're a reason to believe in love again.",
      "Your soul was made of softness and fire â€” both, burning in my memory.",
      "Your presence brings color to my grayscale days.",
      "I don't count the days â€” I count the feelings. And they all lead to you.",
      "You're the calm to my chaos, and the thunder in my quiet.",
      "Today isnâ€™t just your birthday â€” itâ€™s the day my heart silently celebrates the moment the world got you. You make every ordinary day feel like a gift, so today, let me return just a little of that magic to you. Happy Birthday, my love. Iâ€™m so thankful you exist."
